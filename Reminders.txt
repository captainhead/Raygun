Reminders

-Scene.cpp has pretty janky texture reading shoved into "lmbrtn" chunk, needs revising
	-Plan to remove/replace MDL loading
-Scene.h has function to retrieve Materials from matMap, this shouldn't be needed
	-This is now being used in test_scenes.h to retrieve materials by name that have already been stored in the scene object

-Mesh.cpp uv coordinates for quadrilateral intersection don't appear to be correct
	-For now this has been replaced with tesselation into triangle mesh


-Confusion between top-to-bottom vs bottom-to-top when referring to ImageBuffer or image place, i.e. ImageBuffer::getPixel() reads top-to-bottom, while ImageBuffer::setPixel() goes bottom-to-top.
-This affects ImageIO, texture reading and assigning image pixels in ray tracer.

-Vector has w component (point: w=1, direction: w=0), but isn't used (and somewhat replaced) by Matrix
