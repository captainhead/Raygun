Reminders

-Scene.cpp has temp code to load textures through MDL, but its in the wrong spot (get Colour function)
-Scene.h also has function for getting Materials from the material map to allow manual application of textures

-RayTracer.cpp skybox is still set within the ray tracer rather than the scene
	-Still need to decide, should skybox be considered strictly part of the scene? (probably)

-Mesh.cpp uv coordinates for quadrilateral intersection don't appear to be correct
