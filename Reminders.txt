Reminders

-Scene.cpp has pretty janky texture reading shoved into "lmbrtn" chunk, needs revising
-Scene.h has function to retrieve Materials from matMap, this shouldn't be needed

-RayTracer.cpp skybox is still set within the ray tracer rather than the scene
	-Still need to decide, should skybox be considered strictly part of the scene? (probably)

-Mesh.cpp uv coordinates for quadrilateral intersection don't appear to be correct
