-------- Raygun ---------

Currently, Raygun is a basic toy ray tracer project.

Features:
-Win32 window (controls are non-existent at the moment)
	-Planning to move to QT or other cross platform GUI framework.
-loads MDL files (i.e. Cornell box scene)
	-Planning to remove this since provided implementation is older than most trees.
-Meshes (triangles, and quads "tesselated" into triangles), spheres
-Point lights
-Direct diffuse, specular lighting
-Specular reflection
-Transmission/refraction (only for spheres at the moment)
-Basic u,v mapping and texture support
-Perlin Noise generation; used to make basic noisey textures or to modify existing textures (i.e. warping)

Planned features:
-Diffuse reflection
-Area lights
-Transformation (rotation, etc.)
-Depth of field
-Motion blur
-BVH (i.e. octrees)
-GUI (scene and object loading, write image to jpg/png, etc)
-Additional shapes: cylinders, perhaps cones, metaballs (blobs)
